🧠 Explain Like I'm 5
Ever wanted a super smart friend who explains anything like you're five? That’s this app.

🍼 What is this?
Explain Like I'm 5 is a chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that takes complicated stuff (like black holes, taxes, or quantum physics) and explains it in the cutest, simplest way—just like you’re 5 years old.

It’s fun, colorful, and super easy to use.

✨ Features
🎨 Kid-friendly UI – bright, cheerful, and super simple to use

🤖 LLM-powered chatbot using the Gemini API

🧾 Explains anything in plain, baby-smooth language

⚡ Built with Flask (backend) + React (frontend)

🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the project
bash
git clone https://github.com/Sergiu25/ExplainLikeI5.git
